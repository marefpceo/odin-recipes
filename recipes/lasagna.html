    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple, yet great tasting lasagna recipe. The ingredients call for ground beef, but any ground protein </b>
       can be substituted. You can even use shredded chicken.  
    </p>
    <p>It is also best to prepare the dish using all of your ingredients, as the lasagna is good in the freezer for up to </b>
       3 months. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 whole wheat lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lead ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1(16 oz) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheed</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
            Add lasagna noodles and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place ground beef, garlic, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper <br>
            in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is crumbly and evenly <br>
            browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>   
        <li>Lay 4 noodles side by side on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan; top with a layer <br>
            of prepared tomato-basil sauce, a layer of ground beef mixture, and a layer of cottage <br>
            cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice more, ending with a layer of sauce; sprinkle <br>
            mozzarella cheese on top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese has melted, <br>
            about 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese has begun to brown, about 10 <br>
            more minutes. Allow to stand at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>         
    </ol>
